This file contains:
1. evaluation of SchNets reported to be the best for each value in QM9 dataset
2. retrain models starting from the reported best models using HoF data

In ./trained_schnet_models, the reported best models are included, and their performance are evaluated by running ./qm9_pretrained_schnet.py, and results are stored in evaluation_of_models. The MAEs are in eV, and need to be converted to kcal/mol for later comparison.

Values enthalpy_H (enthalpy at 298K) and energy_U0 (internal energy at 0K) are used for HoF calculation. Therefore, the best model for predicting enthalpy_H (best_model_H file in this directory) is used as the starting model for HoF training. 

Original dataset (excluding molecules with experimental values) are in the /processed file.

(raw data, i.e. data downloaded from official website are in /raw file. Original data are processed in this file. Dataset file data_ex_exp.pt is generated by running ./qm9_me.py)

To train: run ./ex_exp.py
Evaluate model: ./evaluate_model.py
